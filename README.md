## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (if using a local database)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-booking.git
   cd university-booking
Install project dependencies:


npm install
or with Yarn:


yarn install
Set up your configuration by creating a config.js file in the project root (see Configuration).

Start the application:


npm start
The server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.

Usage
To use the University Booking System, follow these steps:

Register as a student or dean using the appropriate API endpoints.
Obtain a JWT token after registration or login.
Use the token to access protected API endpoints for viewing sessions and booking sessions.
API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available:

/user/register - Register as a user (student or dean).
/user/login - Log in and obtain a JWT token.
/session/sessions - View available sessions.
/session/book - Book a session.
/session/pending-sessions - View pending sessions for deans.
For detailed API documentation, see the API documentation file.

Configuration
The application requires a config.js file to configure various settings. An example configuration can be found in config.example.js. Customize the configuration to match your environment and preferences.

Database
The University Booking System uses a PostgreSQL database to store user and session data. If you're using an online database service, ensure your config.js file includes the correct connection details.

If you're using a local MySQL database, you can set up the database schema by running Sequelize migrations (not required for online databases).
